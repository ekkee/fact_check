# BUCKLE-Benchmark Fact-Checking
This benchmark on fact checking provides the first comprehensive and publicly available infrastructure for evaluating fact checking methods across a wide range of assumption about the facts and the reference information.

## Download & Install
1. Follow base folders for downloading and installing benchmarking systems: `Knowledge Linker (KL)`, `Discriminative Predicate Path (KGMiner)`, `Path Ranking Algorithm (PRA)`, `Subgraph Feature Extraction (SFE)`, `Parallel Graph Embedding (Para_GraphE)` 
2. Each system has some modifications from the original version, according to the experiments considered in this work.
3. Download [DBPedia]() file used for creating knowledge graph. It contains `relation metadata` (raw triples extracted from Wikipedia infobox), `node_dict`, `edge_dict`. Note: put datasets inside `data/graphs/dbpedia/` directory.

**The server for benchmark will be available online soon.**
