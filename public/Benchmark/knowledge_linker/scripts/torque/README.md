Torque PBS scripts
==================

These BASH scripts can be submitted to any Torque-based queueing system to run
knowledge linker over a cluster. They are provided as-is. You must at least
replace the location of your data, and pick a suitable walltime to request. You
must also make sure that klinker is in your PATH. The scripts can also be run
from the interactive console for testing purposes.
